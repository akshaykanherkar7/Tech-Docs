# Pub-Sub Setup

* **Details About Pub-Sub**
    * Pub-Sub stands for "publish-subscribe" and is a messaging pattern used in software architecture. It involves the communication between different components or services by exchanging messages through a central intermediary known as a message broker. In this pattern, publishers (producers) send messages to the message broker without knowing the identity of the subscribers (consumers) who will receive those messages. Subscribers express their interest in specific types of messages by subscribing to relevant topics or channels.

* In Node.js, you can implement pub-sub using various libraries. One popular choice is the redis library, which provides a feature-rich message broker called Redis.

* To use pub-sub with Node.js and Redis, you'll need to follow these steps:

* **Setup and Installation**

1. Install Redis and the Redis client library for Node.js using npm:
    ```js
      npm install redis

2. Create a publisher script, for example, ** publisher.js **:
    ```js
    const redis = require('redis');
    const publisher = redis.createClient();

    // Publish a message to a channel
    publisher.publish('channelName', 'Hello, subscribers!');
    publisher.publish('channelName', 'Another message.');

    // Close the publisher connection
    publisher.quit();

3. Create a subscriber script, for example, ** subscriber.js **:
    ```js
    const redis = require('redis');
    const subscriber = redis.createClient();

    // Subscribe to a channel
    subscriber.subscribe('channelName');

    // Handle messages received on the subscribed channel
    subscriber.on('message', (channel, message) => {
    console.log(`Received message from ${channel}: ${message}`);
    });

    // Close the subscriber connection
    // subscriber.quit(); // Uncomment this line if you want to quit the connection manually

    // Alternatively, you can listen for other events such as 'subscribe', 'unsubscribe', etc.

4. Run the subscriber script in one terminal:
    ```js
    node subscriber.js

5. Run the publisher script in another terminal:
    ```js
    node publisher.js

* **Once you run the publisher script, the subscriber script will receive the published messages and log them to the console.**

* **Note that this example uses Redis as the message broker, but there are other options available, such as RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or even implementing a custom pub-sub system using frameworks like Socket.IO. The basic pub-sub pattern remains the same, although the specific implementation details may vary.**
